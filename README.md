# Bapt's CAM Workbench

This is a workbench for FreeCAD that adds CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) features.

Let me introduce myself: I'm Bapt.

In my professional life, I've been a programmer/machinist for 10 years now, working on various CNC machines (DMG, Huron, etc.) and in various programming languages ​​(Heidenhain, Siemens, etc.).

And in my personal life, I'm very interested in software programming.

Therefore, I wanted to develop software that would meet my needs, and I found FreeCAD to be a very good basis for developing my own MOD.
